                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>My Name is Brian Aginga Madiang. I was born in the year 
                    1999 in a family of nine children five girls
                    and 4 boys. I am the seventh born and Last born in the 
                    boys category. My education journey started in Burumba primary
                    school in Busia, where I attented both lower school and Middle
                    school. I then proceeded to high school later on and joined st 
                    Mathias Secondary school Busia.
                    </p>
                    <p>After finishing High school, I got a chance to Join Amboseli
                    school of Hospitality. But due to lack of enough funds to 
                    support my higher education the opportunity did not came to
                    pass. I spent gap year trying to figure out what I can do 
                    with my life. With the help of God I found this lady who 
                    introduces me to matter technology, and I believe that was the 
                    path that was design for me.
                    </p>
                    <p> I applied for schorlaships from google platforms, after two weeks my 
                    schorlashipwas approved and I started my higher Education on 
                    IT SUPPORT courses for 1 year. After that I went into Programming
                    where I did Python Programming and Data Science courses offered by IBM
                    for one and have years. And later on I enroll to become Fronted Engineer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I had envisioned my self as a person who will one day Travel the 
                    world and be part and parcel of the Aviation Family. I have made 
                    several trips a cross the wprld trying to advocate for (SAATAM) single African 
                    Air Market. I have always believe that for African connectivity to 
                    grow we must come up with policies that allows African member states
                    citizens to move freely without a VISA being a prerequisite in some<br> 
                    African Borders.
